# Spinal-Code
This project analyzes the biomechanics of a porcine spine sample to determine the Range of Motion (ROM), Nuetral Zone (NZ), and angular displacment under various clinical. conditions, health spine, injured spine, ficated spine. 
The optotrak data collected is stored within the .csv files, smapling frequency 100Hz, 30s duration.
The spine flexor data is stored in the .lvm files, Order of columns is: Zeros, Fx [N], Fy [N], Fz [N], Mx [Nm], My [Nm], Mz [Nm], Time [s].
Data for healthy, injured, and fixated cases are proved for both flexion-extension cases as well as lateral bending cases.
